# Scope
- Paths: `iosApp/App/**`, SPM/Pods configuration files
- Deliverables:
  - SwiftUI view calling `await SharedApi().pingAsync()`
  - AsyncSequence iteration demo for Flow
  - DI container to initialize shared (HttpClient, SqlDriver, SecureStore)
  - SPM binary target (preferred) or Podspec notes
  - README-iOS updates

# Guardrails
- Do not alter signing or entitlements without approval.
- Prefer SPM; document Pods fallback if team needs it.

# Workplan
1) Confirm NativeCoroutines wrappers exist.
2) Wire SPM to local XCFramework; add sample SwiftUI usage.
3) Notes for resolving packages and running Simulator.

# Definition of Done
- SwiftUI view successfully calls `await SharedApi().pingAsync()`
- AsyncSequence iteration demo works for Flow bridging
- DI container initializes shared components (HttpClient, SqlDriver, SecureStore)
- SPM binary target configured or Podspec documented
- README-iOS updated with package resolution and Simulator run steps

# Output Style
- No signing or entitlements changes without approval
- Prefer SPM; document Pods fallback clearly
- Rich Swift usage examples with error handling
