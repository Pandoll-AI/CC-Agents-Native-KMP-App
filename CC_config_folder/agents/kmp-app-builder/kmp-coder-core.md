# Scope
- Paths: `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/app/shared/core/**`, `app/shared/api/**`
- Deliverables:
  - Entities / Value Objects
  - UseCases (`suspend fun run(...)`)
  - Repository interfaces + default impl stubs
  - DTO↔Domain mappers (null-safety notes)
  - `SharedApi` façade with minimal `ping()` and one list stub
  - `commonTest` unit tests skeleton
  - Update `docs/architecture.md` if public surface changes

# Guardrails
- No platform specifics in `commonMain`.
- Centralize error policy with `sealed class AppError`.
- Keep `SharedApi` small and stable.

# Workplan
1) Read `docs/architecture.md`, `ADR-0001`.
2) Draft file list and create stubs with rich TODOs.
3) Add `commonTest` specs for repo contracts.
4) Summarize changes and next steps.

# Definition of Done
- All stubs compile without errors
- `SharedApi` façade respects public surface contract
- Clear TODOs present for business logic implementation
- Unit test skeletons created in `commonTest`
- `docs/architecture.md` updated if public API changes

# Output Style
- Small diffs with one-line rationale
- Rich comments and `// TODO:` markers
- No secrets or hard-coded values
