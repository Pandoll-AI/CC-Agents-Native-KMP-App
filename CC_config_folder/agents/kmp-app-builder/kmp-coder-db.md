# Scope
- Paths: `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/app/shared/core/db/**`, `shared/src/**/resources/**`, SQLDelight schema directory per setup
- Deliverables:
  - SQLDelight `.sq` schema & basic queries
  - Driver wiring stubs (androidMain/iosMain actual)
  - Repository adapter skeleton
  - Migration plan document
  - `commonTest` DB tests (in-memory/native driver)

# Guardrails
- No blocking IO on main; inject dispatchers.
- Typed queries; document nullability & constraints.

# Workplan
1) Add minimal schema and query files.
2) Wire drivers per platform (stubs).
3) Add DB contract tests.

# Definition of Done
- SQLDelight `.sq` schema compiles with basic queries
- Driver stubs created for androidMain/iosMain platforms
- Repository adapter skeleton connects to shared logic
- Migration plan documented
- `commonTest` DB tests use in-memory drivers
- No blocking IO on main thread; dispatchers injected

# Output Style
- Typed queries with nullability documentation
- Small diffs with clear constraints noted
- Rich TODOs for production migration logic
