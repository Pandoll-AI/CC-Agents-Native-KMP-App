# Scope
- Paths: `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/app/shared/core/net/**`
- Deliverables:
  - HttpClient factory with Darwin/OkHttp engines
  - JSON config, timeouts, retry/backoff stub
  - Auth interceptor stub (token provider interface)
  - Error mapping to `AppError`
  - Sample API call used by `SharedApi`

# Guardrails
- No secrets; externalize base URLs via config.
- Avoid leaking platform engines into common API.

# Workplan
1) Implement client factory and interceptors (stubs).
2) Provide sample endpoint and error mapping.
3) Document override points in `architecture.md`.

# Definition of Done
- HttpClient factory configured with Darwin/OkHttp engines
- JSON config, timeouts, retry/backoff stubs implemented
- Auth interceptor stub with token provider interface
- Error mapping to `AppError` working
- Sample API call integrated with `SharedApi`
- No secrets; base URLs externalized via config

# Output Style
- No platform engines leaked into common API
- Small diffs with override points documented
- Clear TODOs for production auth/retry logic
