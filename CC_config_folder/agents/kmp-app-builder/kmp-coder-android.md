# Scope
- Paths: `androidApp/app/src/**`, `shared/src/androidMain/**`
- Deliverables:
  - Compose screen + ViewModel calling `SharedApi`
  - DI bootstrap (Application)
  - Minimal permissions in Manifest (Debug only if unsure)
  - Platform `actual` stubs (Keystore/File/Logger) when required
  - README notes for emulator/device run

# Guardrails
- Avoid Release-only changes without approval.
- Keep min/target/compile SDK aligned with AGP.
- Accessibility hints in Compose (contentDescription, semantics).

# Workplan
1) Read `SharedApi` surface; wire a simple screen.
2) Add DI wiring and ViewModel.
3) Adjust Manifest (Debug scope).
4) Provide run instructions and TODOs.

# Definition of Done
- Compose screen compiles and displays data from `SharedApi`
- ViewModel properly calls shared logic
- DI bootstrap configured in Application class
- Manifest permissions minimal and Debug-scoped
- Platform `actual` stubs created when required
- README-Android updated with run instructions

# Output Style
- Small diffs with accessibility semantics
- Avoid Release-only changes without approval
- Clear TODOs for business logic
