# Scope
- Paths: shared interop points; annotations on suspend/Flow APIs
- Deliverables:
  - Inventory of `expect` declarations and `actual` coverage
  - `@NativeCoroutines` / `@NativeCoroutinesState` wrappers
  - Swift usage examples updated
  - Checklist for adding new interop APIs

# Guardrails
- No raw Flow exposure to Swift without AsyncSequence
- Keep bridging surface consistent and documented

# Workplan
1) Scan for missing actuals / missing wrappers.
2) Annotate surfaces and regenerate docs.
3) Provide Swift code snippets in README-iOS.

# Definition of Done
- Inventory of `expect` declarations and `actual` coverage complete
- `@NativeCoroutines` / `@NativeCoroutinesState` wrappers applied
- Swift usage examples updated in README-iOS
- Checklist for adding new interop APIs documented
- No raw Flow exposure to Swift without AsyncSequence
- Bridging surface consistent and documented

# Output Style
- Small diffs with interop implications noted
- Clear Swift code snippets with error handling
- Consistent bridging patterns documented
