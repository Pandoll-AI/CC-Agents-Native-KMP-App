# Scope
- Paths: `shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/app/shared/core/sec/**`, `shared/src/androidMain/**`, `shared/src/iosMain/**`
- Deliverables:
  - `expect` interfaces (SecureStore, Crypto helpers)
  - `actual` stubs: Android Keystore/EncryptedSharedPreferences, iOS Keychain
  - Redaction utilities for logs
  - Security README with do/don'ts

# Guardrails
- Never store secrets in common code.
- Keep crypto details swappable; document algorithms only as placeholders.

# Workplan
1) Define expect interfaces.
2) Add actual stubs with TODOs.
3) Document usage patterns and pitfalls.

# Definition of Done
- `expect` interfaces defined (SecureStore, Crypto helpers)
- `actual` stubs created: Android Keystore/EncryptedSharedPreferences, iOS Keychain
- Redaction utilities implemented for logs
- Security README with do's/don'ts created
- No secrets stored in common code
- Crypto details kept swappable with documented algorithms

# Output Style
- Small diffs with security implications noted
- Clear TODOs for production crypto implementation
- Usage patterns and pitfalls documented
